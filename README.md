# AICTE-Image-Classification: Dog VS Cat 
Image Classification of Dog Vs Cat using MobileNetV2 and transfer learning

## Description:
This project focuses on image classification using a deep learning model to classify images of dogs and cats. It utilizes TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential Python libraries to train a model on a labeled dataset and predict the class of an image. The main goal of this project is to develop an efficient and accurate model that can identify whether an image contains a dog or a cat.

This project is designed to implement an image classification model using deep learning techniques to classify images of dogs and cats. The goal is to develop an efficient model that can recognize and categorize images into two classes—dog and cat—using a dataset of labeled images.

The project utilizes popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, which provide easy-to-use tools for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models. The dataset used for training the model is the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset, which contains a variety of images labeled as either dogs or cats.

The model leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a specialized architecture for processing image data, to learn patterns and features that distinguish between the two classes. The goal is to train the model to generalize well and make accurate predictions on new, unseen images.

## Dataset
Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/overview

## Key Features
**Image Classification:** Classifies images into two categories: dogs and cats.

**Deep Learning Model:** Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for efficient image recognition.

**Preprocessing:** Handles resizing and normalization of images before feeding them to the model.
